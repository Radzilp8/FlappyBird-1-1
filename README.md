Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen!

Before running this open-source FlappyBird 1-1 game, please follow these steps to set it up correctly:

Import the Database
Import the Leaderboard.sql file into your XAMPP server (we used XAMPP for this project).

Install the MySQL Connector JAR File
Download the JAR file from this link 'https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/' and add it to the project's Referenced Libraries.

Customize the Font
Replace the default font in the game with your favorite font for a personalized experience.

Final Step
Before running the program, donâ€™t forget to say Bismillah!
